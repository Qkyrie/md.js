###Prerequisites
Md.js only has one dependency, jQuery. You can download it from github: [development](https://github.com/Qkyrie/md.js/releases/download/1.0.0/md.js) or [minified](https://github.com/Qkyrie/md.js/releases/download/1.0.0/md.min.js)

> This documentation was loaded using md.js, we're using md.js, to create the documentation of md.js. That's quite some document-ception!
